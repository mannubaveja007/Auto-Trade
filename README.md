## üéØ Demo Scenario: McDonald's Sauce Procurement

Here's how to test the AutoTrade MVP with a realistic B2B procurement scenario:

### Step 1: Create a Procurement Request
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Create Request" tab
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Company**: McDonald's Corp
   - **Product**: Tomato Sauce
   - **Category**: Food Ingredients
   - **Quantity**: 1000
   - **Unit**: Liters
   - **Delivery Date**: Pick a future date
   - **Max Budget**: 5000
   - **Urgency**: High
   - **Specifications**: "Food grade, no preservatives, organic preferred"

4. Click "Create Request & Find Vendors"

### Step 2: AI Vendor Matching
The system will automatically:
- Find suitable vendors in the "food-ingredients" category
- Generate personalized outreach messages
- Simulate vendor responses with realistic quotes
- Create initial quotes with competitive pricing

### Step 3: View and Compare Quotes
1. Click "All Requests" tab to see your procurement request
2. Click "View Quotes & Negotiations" to see vendor responses
3. Compare quotes from different vendors:
   - Fresh Ingredients Co
   - Premium Sauce Suppliers
   - Bulk Food Solutions

### Step 4: AI-Powered Negotiations
1. Click on any quote to select it
2. In the negotiations section, send messages like:
   - "Can you reduce the price to $2000?"
   - "Can you deliver by Friday instead?"
   - "Do you offer volume discounts?"

3. Watch as AI agents respond on behalf of vendors with realistic counter-offers

### Step 5: Accept Quote and Place Order
1. When satisfied with a quote, click "Accept Quote"
2. This creates an order and completes the procurement process

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Yellow Network Integration)

When integrated with Yellow Network's technology:

- **Private Transactions**: Sensitive pricing and supplier relationships stay confidential
- **Multi-chain Payments**: Pay vendors on their preferred blockchain (Polygon, Celo, Base)
- **State Channels**: Fast, cheap settlement for repeat orders
- **Tamper-proof Records**: Immutable audit trail for compliance
- **Cross-chain Settlement**: Seamless payments across different networks

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d autotrade_mvp

# Reset database if needed
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### AI Features Not Working
- Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in .env
- Check OpenAI API quota and billing
- AI features will gracefully degrade if API is unavailable

### Port Conflicts
- Backend: Change PORT in .env file
- Frontend: Change port in vite.config.js
